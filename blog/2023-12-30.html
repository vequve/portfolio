               <p>New website update <b>YUPPIE<b>, i wanted to redo some of the css since it was a complete mess and here we are! I came back to this website and i had no fucking idea on everything worked and let me tell you it <b>wasn't fun</b>. I also removed every trace of javascript from this website, cause why not :3. I'm probably gonna do two separates css files for the blog and the homepage since i'm probably gonna need to change a lot of stuff in one page to another, i need to also change the colorscheme the win 98 one is really ugly lol. This website update post became a todo list llol</p>
